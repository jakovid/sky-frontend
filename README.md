# Bi-Lingual School Website (Frontend)

A complete solution built using Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, with a backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a bilingual (English and Chinese) website for a school based in Taipei, Taiwan.

**Background:** The school wanted a bilingual platform both for potential customers and for the attraction of new teaching and administrative staff. The journey of this project involved multiple stages and iterations. It started with a CMS-based approach, transitioned into a React app hosted on GitHub Pages using a HashRouter, and culminated in its current version powered by Next.js with a robust backend.

### Features

**For Users:**

- Quick language toggle
- Contact form integration with EmailJS
- Designed with a mobile-first approach

**For Admin:**

- Secure login and authentication
- Seamless API communication with MongoDB and Cloudinary
- Content update capability in both English and Chinese
- Image modification tools
- Staff and teacher management options
